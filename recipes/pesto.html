   <img src="images/pesto.jpg"> 
<p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
</p>
<p>A spicy chicken and pesto pasta dish that's easy to adjust to any heat level. I created it after eating a similar dish at a Santa Monica restaurant, and it's one of my favorites. Serve with additional grated Parmesan, if desired. As an option, it's delicious with creamy goat cheese stirred in at the end.</p>
<p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package uncooked farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot chile paste (such as sambal oelek)</li>
        <li> 1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch pieces</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons prepared basil pesto</li>
        <li> ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>   
<ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place farfalle pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain.</li>
    <li> Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Mix in the chile paste and chicken. Cook and stir chicken 10 minutes, or until evenly browned and juices run clear.</li>
    <li> Toss the cooked farfalle, pesto, Parmesan cheese, and cilantro into the skillet, and continue cooking just until heated through.</li>
</ol>
